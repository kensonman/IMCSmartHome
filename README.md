Introduction
----
This is the project folder that contains all the IMC SmartHome project material, including
report, source-code, screendump, test case, etc..

This is the working report of the research project “Instant Message Controllable Smart Home”. This is the feasibility study of using the instant messaging technologies to control the smart-home. It will apply the Instant Messaging, IOT (Internet Of Things) technologies, Distributed System, Cloud Technologies into the project. This report will primary aim at the Introduction, Project Idea, Studying, Research, Designing, Implementation and Evaluation phase in the project.
The project will deliver a system named the “IMC Smart Home System” (Instant Message Controllable Smart Home System). It will integrate the instant messaging platform and IOT technology to make the Home Device controllable by user through the instant messaging. The system should also investigate how to provide the standardized interface for the hardware manufacturers to integrate their smart-home-device to join  the home-network.
